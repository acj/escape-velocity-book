"... escape velocity?  It's too much ..." the woman's voice had said.

Jesse stopped, wheeling around to find the voice, but it was lost in the groggy brook of sounds and suitcoats moving toward him, away from him, and breaking around him.  He had just been thinking about his job and remembering his mother's advice.  /When you're stuck but ambition pulls you up, use it, you're already at escape velocity/... .

/Nobody else's mother teaches life lessons with physics metaphores/, he thought, allowing himself a wry smile.  He looked across Bedford Avenue, took a deep breath, and stepped back into the stream of Brooklyners.


The City University of New York Office of Internal Affairs was cold this morning.  The calendar above Sascha Greene's desk would lead one to believe that summer raged on, but the brisk morning air left no doubt that late September was a better guess.

"Sascha, the top feed is ready," called a voice near the window.  The Office of Internal Affairs, despite the lofty title, was a cramped, stuffy office that contained five desks, eighteen computers and other office machines, and could comfortably fit three bodies, provided that the bodies were reasonably proportioned and were not given to clumsiness.  Sascha sat facing the north wall, preferring not to be distracted by the constant movement of his colleagues.  Jill, the office technology specialist, sat near the windows where she could keep a watchful eye on the myriad devices that kept the room warm.  Sean, the interdepartmental liason (the External Internal Affairs Spokesman, Sascha called him), worked at a stand-up desk that was mounted on the west wall between the two oat doors.  The remainder of the 600 square foot space was a labyrinth of machines, cables clamped to the floor with black duct tape, stacks of official university records, and the occasional abandoned coffee mug.  The abundance of machines meant that one window propped open year-around.

"Got it."  Sascha stretched his shoulders and called up the day's list of business items that had been assembled by the administrative assistants on the floor above.  Amazing that these lists ever get out the door.  Sascha knew that despite the polished look of the top feed, it was the result of hours of messy negotiations, hearsay, and petty politics.  If the students only knew what they were paying for, he thought.

The top feed was a document that laid out, in gory and often career-damaging detail, each instance of academic dishonesty, professional misconduct, inter-departmental dispute, and plenty of other violations of laws or university policies.  The name of each involved party, whether accuser or accused, was listed in bold print alongside a description of the incident and various recommendations that the faculty senate or (in severe cases) the board of directors had made for resolving the issue at hand.  A copy was emailed to the president of the university, the ombudsman, the vice president of Internal Affairs (Sascha's superior), and the chief of university police.  Several delicate, high-profile cases had been exposed when details from the top feed had made their way into local newspapers, placing the university in an awkward situation.

Scanning through the list, Sascha spotted a familiar name.  He took a drink from his coffee mug, taking a moment to process the news.

"Jill, did you see that Winter is on the list again?" he said, his eyes still on the computer screen.

"Hadn't noticed.  What's the claim?" Jill asked.

"Espionage and destruction of university property," Sasched said, his voice laced with disbelief.

Sascha heard the steady rhythm of Jill's typing stop abruptly.  He turned to face her.  "This isn't his first time on the feed, but it sounds like it could be his last.  And I'd bet my left nut that he's innocent."

Jill ignored the comment.  "I'll admit that espionage is over the top, even for this group of suits.  Winter's first time was inconclusive, though, and you have to admit that it was fishy.

"Fishy or not, the guy has a good moral compass.  He's innocent."

The rhythmic typing resumed, and Sascha turned back to his computer.  He scrawled a note on his legal pad, downed the last of his coffee, and left the office.

Jesse swallowed hard, wondering how he had gotten here.  The university's prosecutor had just painted him as a screwoff that, even though he should never have been hired, /most definitely/ should not be allowed to handle anything more than a press release for an obscure bit of undergraduate research.  Jesse had admired the bastard's poise and confidence as he delivered one gently stretched fact after another, building to a rousing conclusion that even Jesse found convincing but didn't agree with reality.  /Never let the facts get in the way/, Jesse thought to himself.

Three weeks earlier, Jesse had just finished writing a report for his superiors that evaluated the success of a new program at CUNY that paired journalism students with investigative reporters from major news organizations and private investigative agencies.  William Tweedie, the current president of CUNY, had made it his personal mission to restore investigative journalism to its rightful place as a tool that feeds the beating heart of democracy.  In addition to the partnership with private agencies, the vision stated, students would conduct an internship overseas in an area of strategic interest to the United States.  Military zones and several unfriendly nations were understandable excluded, but this did nothing to blunt the flood of criticism that the Tweedie, and the university as a whole, endured in the months that followed.

One prominent liberal blog bemoaned the arrogance and gall of a university president who would put his students at risk in foreign political landscapes where the local newspapers were as likely to carry a story about a reporter who had been jailed and executed as a spy as they were to discuss news about the London Stock Exchange.  Conservative hawks were just as eager to pounce, declaring investigative journalism a dead art that shouldn't be put on life support.  The interference of reporters in military and diplomatic affairs, they went on, had a detrimental effect on combat effectiveness and encouraged commanders and politicians to withdraw from public inquiry and debate for fear of being mischaracterized in the press.

Tweedie refused to pull the plug on the program that had made him a household name.  Perhaps by taking public figures to task and embracing modern technology as a means of tracking and eliminating corruption, he argued, the young public can wrest control of its future from the cash-heavy organizations that have a key vested interest in keeping everyone in the dark.  It took a toll on him, which was evidenced most clearly by the private security detail that he hired to keep a few eyes on his family's small house.  His efforts to promote investigative journalism and to encourage students to take up the fight inspired many, especially students in France and elsewhere in the United States, to form impromptu groups of vigilanti reporters.  There were nearly reports of students being arrested or harrassed by police after they had been found trespassing or had been accused of stalking.  While the actions of these student reporters departed from what Tweedie had intended, it told him something important: the will to peel back the layers of secrecy and deceit that crippled the public's understanding of major events, long thought to be lost on the young generations of the 21st century, was alive and well.

At the time of his first trial, Jesse Winter was 29.  A graduate of University of Colorado at Boulder, he held a dual degree in public policy and mathematics, with a concentration in information technology policy.  He had also taken a minor in poetry.  Jesse had served as the president of the campus debate club, had a senior internship at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and wrote a technology column for a Boulder newspaper.

Jesse joined CUNY fresh out of college.  He had been offered positions at the Independent newspaper in the United Kingdom and a handful of private firms in Germany and the northeastern United States.  Making the decision to stay in the U.S. had been difficult, but the job paid well enough that Jesse could afford to travel and satisfy his interest in foreign politics.  His official title was Special Deputy to the Dean, working in the Office of the Ombudsman.  While this was misleading--his duties frequently involved international travel to undisclosed locations and conferring with individuals that the university could not publicly recognize as partners--much of his work was in the vein of settling disputes.

When William Tweedie had announced his pet program for reinvigorating investigative journalism, he had personally notified Jesse that his job description would be changing.  If he felt comfortable with the plan, then he was welcome to stay.  Jesse was intrigued by the promise of hush-hush work, additional travel, and doing his part to promote an old component of journalism that he had found lacking.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement, agreed to the revised terms, and came to work the next week to find that his desk and computer had been removed.  In its place was a note from the dean and a plane ticket without a marked destination that left from a terminal at JFK that Jesse had  never heard of.  "This should be educational," he said, turning on his heel and heading toward the elevator.

"You're going to eastern Europe," the dean had told him.  "The flight plan has been filed, and your pilot knows what to do.  Here's some background for you to read over while you're over the Atlantic."  He handed Jesse a thin tablet computer whose only marking was a serial number etched into the upper right corner.

"What's the scoop?" Jesse asked, running his hand over the tablet.

"You'll find everything on there," said the dean.  "This project is the president's baby, and you probably know more than I do.  When you land, use the switch on the side of the tablet to securely erase its flash memory.  None of the information on it is illegal, but it's sensitive and we don't want you getting tied up in a rumble with immigration."

"All right," Jesse said.  He noted the location of the secure erasure switch and looked back at the dean.  "Should I pay an extra month's rent, or is this a visit for tea?"

The dean laughed.  "See you in two weeks, son."

					* * *

The flight was uneventful.  The Astra Jets 1125 was cozy and quiet, carrying only three men.  Jesse had met the pilot, Lars Millsen, at a recent faculty meeting.  Jesse's nervous finger tapping caught the attention of Milssen on one occasion, prompting him to whisper something to his first officer.  A moment later, he was sitting next to Jesse in the front row of the cabin and placing a hot drink on each of their tray tables.  Jesse instinctively steadied the mug, but Milssen put him at ease.

"Don't worry, the bottoms are magnetic," Milssen said, gently tipping his own mug from side to side to show the resistance of the magnet.  "One of the perks of these corporate birds."

Jesse smiled and took a drink, trying to ease the knot in his stomach.  Green tea.  One of his favorites.  Jesse had already slogged through the 65 pages of minutiae related to the trip, undoubtedly written by the same smiling administrative assistants who handled all of the university's laundry.  He was bound for Warsaw, Poland, a place that he had visited twice for pleasure.  The third visit would be a tense one.

"Ready for duty?" Milssen asked with a smile.

"Not a chance," Jesse said, "but I'll do what I can.  These kids really stepped in it."

"The bits of news that have made it to my ear haven't been good.  Be careful, and we'll see you Thursday evening.  Give me a call when you're packed up.  We'll be starting our descent in about twenty."

Milssen handed Jesse a black prepaid mobile phone, shook his hand, and walked back to the cockpit.

Jesse knew that tomorrow, Wednesday, would be a tense affair.  He kept his nerves hidden, but his bowels never got the memo.  /I won't be doing this until I retire, unless they let me go at 32/, he thought, looking out the tiny window at the hills of central Europe.

The kids had /really/ stepped in it.  One student, the son of Polish immigrants, had enrolled in the new investigative journalism program at CUNY with a personal mission to prove that his father's failed bid for a seat on the Warsaw City Council in 1986.  The family was convinced that an opponent had floated a rumor about his father's marital fidelity shortly before the election, and that another political rival had abused her position of power at town meetings as a soapbox for making inaccurate statements about the family's intentions.  The student, Sam Rzeznik, had recruited two of his classmates to join him in Poland for a month to investigate the case.

The true story, however, had only come to light after the team of students was arrested by Interpol for breaking into the offices of a local political party and installing recording devices.  The official application for funds had stated that the team would be investigating instances of polling irregularities at a handful of small voting precincts outside of Warsaw.  The low-key nature of the trip, and the delicate issue at hand, had won over the review board and brought praise from William Tweedie.  The team had been awarded a travel and research grant for $8,000, enough to keep them fed and mobile for 30 days.

It was the voice recorder in the men's room that led to their arrest.  The team had installed surveillance equipment in two conference rooms, the office of a senior staffer, and the men's room.  The argument for putting microphones near the toilets was simple: plenty of informal chit-chat and joking happens when people are washing their hands.  If they could soak up the official line from the board room and grab the raw, unalloyed truth from the loo, then the team had an odds-on chance of landing a good story.

A week after the team had installed the equipment and left the building without raising an alarm, a pipe in the ceiling above the men's room had burst, soaking the voice recorder and flooding two rooms.  The office hired a pair of plumbers to repair the pipes and assess the damage.  The workers had no reason to suspect foul play when they found a waterlogged voice recorder, and they threw it into a strap pile with everything else that had shown water damage.  When the office manager came around to get an assessment from the men and learned about the voice recorder, he immediately dialed the chief of police.  After pulling the tapes from the office's own video surveillance system, it took less than an hour to work out what had happened.

Legally, Sam Rzeznik needed a miracle.  The police and Polish immigration authorities were able to match the images on the video tapes to photos on the students' visa paperwork, making the investigation quick and decisive.  If his case went to trial, the prospects were grim.  The evidence against him was devastating.  His academic career would be over for violating the terms of his admission to the investigative journalism program.  Even if he was acquitted, his extended family who still lived in Poland could face harassment, physical threats, or worse.  The other students on the team were in a better position to negotiate a reduced sentence, but they would still face jail time if convicted.

Jesse tipped his taxi driver and stepped out of the cab onto a busy street in Warsaw.  Opening his umbrella, he looked up at the massive stone columns that flanked the entrance to the historic courthouse.  To his right was a series of shops that included a barber shop, a Greenpeace branch office, and a small coffee shop that had a cupcake protruding from the wall above its traditional-looking iron door.  Checking his impression against the description written on the napkin in his hand, he convinced himself that it was the right venue.  Jesse had no idea what to expect for the next two hours, but William Tweedie had sent him for a reason.

The cafe was busy but had a very European charm.  Jesse unbuttoned his overcoat, walking slowly toward the rear of the cafe as his senses took in the environment.  At the bar that lined the left side of the cafe, a woman was animatedly telling the bartender something about a bracelet that she was wearing.  Next to her, a bearded man in a suit turned to stare at Jesse as he walked past.  A waitress brushed against Jesse's arm, startling him and prompting terse apology.  On the other side of the cafe was a set of staggered four-seat tables, and along the back wall was a pair of high tables with two seats each.  At one of the high tables was a young-looking man with wiry hair pulled back into a ponytail who was reading a newspaper.  He was dressed in an expensive dress shirt and had draped his sport jacket over the back of his chair.  As Jesse approached, the man glanced up from his newspaper and looked him over.

"Jesse Winter?" the man said.  His voice was clear despite an accent that Jesse couldn't place, but the accent didn't concern him as much as the lack of friendliness.  Jesse reminded himself that he shouldn't expect to make friends today.  /Time to go to work/.

"Pleased to meet you.  Mr...?" Jesse said, offering his hand.

The man stood up, shaking Jesse's hand.  "Jasna.  Marcel Jasna.  You can call me Marcel.  May I call you Jesse?"

"Sure," Jesse said.

"Shall we sit, then?" said Marcel, gesturing to the empty chair across the small table.

Jesse pulled off his overcoat, draping it over the back of his chair, and sat down.  Immediately, a waiter was beside him to take his drink preference.  Recalling that Marcel had a glass of scotch on the table, he ordered a gin and tonic.  Stretching his shoulders, Jesse turned back to Marcel and offered a disarming smile.

"Well, Jesse, it's no secret why we come here today," Marcel said simply.  "The manager of my brother's political office caught your students in his building.  It was clear to us that they were spying on our meetings and attempting to sabotage our campaign.  We have video and audio evidence from the night when they entered the building and left recording devices.  This is, as you say, an open and shut case, don't you think?"

Jesse opened his mouth to respond, but Marcel had paused only for rhetorical effect.  He went on: "My brother has no interest in ruining the lives of young people.  But he finds your program that encourages students to become foreign spies for the United States to be distasteful and shameful.  If students go to jail for a time in order to bring the proper shame on your program, very few Polish citizens here will pay attention.  Your program is unpopular in your own country, yes?"

This time Marcel stopped to wait for a response, but Jesse sensed a trap.  "The program enjoys strong support from many quarters," he offered.

"Yes, there are always those who see public servants as corrupt by definition.  Have you noticed that foreign politicians are always corrupt, but your government does not look at its own face in a mirror?"  Marcel took a drink from his glass, then cleared his throat.  "This is not so simple as you think, Jesse.  You are thinking of your students, their future, their families, your president, perhaps your job.  We understand that it is far deeper.  Each time our politicians are painted as corrupt, Poland suffers.  We have suffered under the heel of such injustice for most of a century."

Jesse shifted in his seat.  "Marcel, these students lied to us.  I understand your position on spying, and I know that from your vantage point we seem to be training a new crop of young spies.  You need to know that these students were not authorized to conduct themselves in this way.  They lied on the application, and they lied to the review committee."

"This does not change substance of the situation."

"That's correct.  But it changes the details of the situation that you and I care about.  We're not here to debate state philosophies on espionage.  This is about the welfare of a group of kids who, while they showed themselves to be overzealous, have passion and talent that /must/ be put to productive uses.  Do you see?"

Marcel responded immediately.  "With respect, the fate of the students is beside the point.  This is an issue of national and political sovereignty, and we intend to treat it as such.  I must admit that I do not think we will reach a settlement.  We must not appear weak in the face of interference from America, even if the face is that of a young spy ring."

The waiter returned with Jesse's drink, taking the unspoken hint that the men were not interested in ordering a meal.

"Our university is prepared to work with you, sir," Jesse continued.  We have no interest in inflaming the relationship between the U.S. and a friendly nation such as Poland.  We know that despite your feelings about espionage, it would not bode well for your campaign to be associated with the arrest of a Polish student."  Turning his palms upward in a conciliatory gesture, Jesse added, "What options remain on the table?"

Marcel leaned back in his seat and tilted his head to the right, clearly wondering what Jesse had been in Jesse's mind as he spoke those words.  It was a moment before he spoke again.  "You offer us money, Jesse?"

"We are prepared to cover the costs of the repairs to your brother's office, as well as any legal costs that you've absorbed.  Beyond that, well... this is a negotiation."

"Please excuse me for a moment, Jesse," Marcel said, rising to his feet and walking toward the back door of the cafe.

/Time for a conference during the powwow/, Jesse thought to himself.
