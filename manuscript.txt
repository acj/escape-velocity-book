"... escape velocity?  It's too much ..." the woman's voice had said.

Jesse stopped, wheeling around to find the voice, but it was lost in the groggy brook of sounds and suitcoats moving toward him, away from him, and breaking around him.  He had just been thinking about his job and remembering his mother's advice.  /When you're stuck but ambition pulls you up, use it, you're already at escape velocity/... .

/Nobody else's mother teaches life lessons with physics metaphores/, he thought, allowing himself a wry smile.  He looked across Bedford Avenue, took a deep breath, and stepped back into the stream of Brooklyners.


The City University of New York Office of Internal Affairs was cold this morning.  The calendar above Sascha Greene's desk would lead one to believe that summer raged on, but the brisk morning air left no doubt that late September was a better guess.

"Sascha, the top feed is ready," called a voice near the window.  The Office of Internal Affairs, despite the lofty title, was a cramped, stuffy office that contained five desks, eighteen computers and other office machines, and could comfortably fit three bodies, provided that the bodies were reasonably proportioned and were not given to clumsiness.  Sascha sat facing the north wall, preferring not to be distracted by the constant movement of his colleagues.  Jill, the office technology specialist, sat near the windows where she could keep a watchful eye on the myriad devices that kept the room warm.  Sean, the interdepartmental liason (the External Internal Affairs Spokesman, Sascha called him), worked at a stand-up desk that was mounted on the west wall between the two oat doors.  The remainder of the 600 square foot space was a labyrinth of machines, cables clamped to the floor with black duct tape, stacks of official university records, and the occasional abandoned coffee mug.  The abundance of machines meant that one window propped open year-around.

"Got it."  Sascha stretched his shoulders and called up the day's list of business items that had been assembled by the administrative assistants on the floor above.  Amazing that these lists ever get out the door.  Sascha knew that despite the polished look of the top feed, it was the result of hours of messy negotiations, hearsay, and petty politics.  If the students only knew what they were paying for, he thought.

The top feed was a document that laid out, in gory and often career-damaging detail, each instance of academic dishonesty, professional misconduct, inter-departmental dispute, and plenty of other violations of laws or university policies.  The name of each involved party, whether accuser or accused, was listed in bold print alongside a description of the incident and various recommendations that the faculty senate or (in severe cases) the board of directors had made for resolving the issue at hand.  A copy was emailed to the president of the university, the ombudsman, the vice president of Internal Affairs (Sascha's superior), and the chief of university police.  Several delicate, high-profile cases had been exposed when details from the top feed had made their way into local newspapers, placing the university in an awkward situation.

Scanning through the list, Sascha spotted a familiar name.  He took a drink from his coffee mug, taking a moment to process the news.

"Jill, did you see that Winter is on the list again?" he said, his eyes still on the computer screen.

"Hadn't noticed.  What's the claim?" Jill asked.

"Espionage and destruction of university property," Sasched said, his voice laced with disbelief.

Sascha heard the steady rhythm of Jill's typing stop abruptly.  He turned to face her.  "This isn't his first time on the feed, but it sounds like it could be his last.  And I'd bet my left nut that he's innocent."

Jill ignored the comment.  "I'll admit that espionage is over the top, even for this group of suits.  Winter's first time was inconclusive, though, and you have to admit that it was fishy.

"Fishy or not, the guy has a good moral compass.  He's innocent."

The rhythmic typing resumed, and Sascha turned back to his computer.  He scrawled a note on his legal pad, downed the last of his coffee, and left the office.

Jesse swallowed hard, wondering how he had gotten here.  The university's prosecutor had just painted him as a screwoff that, even though he should never have been hired, /most definitely/ should not be allowed to handle anything more than a press release for an obscure bit of undergraduate research.  Jesse had admired the bastard's poise and confidence as he delivered one gently stretched fact after another, building to a rousing conclusion that even Jesse found convincing but didn't agree with reality.  /Never let the facts get in the way/, Jesse thought to himself.

Three weeks earlier, Jesse had just finished writing a report for his superiors that evaluated the success of a new program at CUNY that paired journalism students with investigative reporters from major news organizations and private investigative agencies.  William Tweedie, the current president of CUNY, had made it his personal mission to restore investigative journalism to its rightful place as a tool that feeds the beating heart of democracy.  In addition to the partnership with private agencies, the vision stated, students would conduct an internship overseas in an area of strategic interest to the United States.  Military zones and several unfriendly nations were understandable excluded, but this did nothing to blunt the flood of criticism that the Tweedie, and the university as a whole, endured in the months that followed.

One prominent liberal blog bemoaned the arrogance and gall of a university president who would put his students at risk in foreign political landscapes where the local newspapers were as likely to carry a story about a reporter who had been jailed and executed as a spy as they were to discuss news about the London Stock Exchange.  Conservative hawks were just as eager to pounce, declaring investigative journalism a dead art that shouldn't be put on life support.  The interference of reporters in military and diplomatic affairs, they went on, had a detrimental effect on combat effectiveness and encouraged commanders and politicians to withdraw from public inquiry and debate for fear of being mischaracterized in the press.

Tweedie refused to pull the plug on the program that had made him a household name.  Perhaps by taking public figures to task and embracing modern technology as a means of tracking and eliminating corruption, he argued, the young public can wrest control of its future from the cash-heavy organizations that have a key vested interest in keeping everyone in the dark.  It took a toll on him, which was evidenced most clearly by the private security detail that he hired to keep a few eyes on his family's small house.  His efforts to promote investigative journalism and to encourage students to take up the fight inspired many, especially students in France and elsewhere in the United States, to form impromptu groups of vigilanti reporters.  There were nearly reports of students being arrested or harrassed by police after they had been found trespassing or had been accused of stalking.  While the actions of these student reporters departed from what Tweedie had intended, it told him something important: the will to peel back the layers of secrecy and deceit that crippled the public's understanding of major events, long thought to be lost on the young generations of the 21st century, was alive and well.

At the time of his first trial, Jesse Winter was 29.  A graduate of University of Colorado at Boulder, he held a dual degree in public policy and mathematics, with a concentration in information technology policy.  He had also taken a minor in poetry.  Jesse had served as the president of the campus debate club, had a senior internship at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and wrote a technology column for a Boulder newspaper.

Jesse joined CUNY fresh out of college.  He had been offered positions at the Independent newspaper in the United Kingdom and a handful of private firms in Germany and the northeastern United States.  Making the decision to stay in the U.S. had been difficult, but the job paid well enough that Jesse could afford to travel and satisfy his interest in foreign politics.  His official title was Special Deputy to the Dean, working in the Office of the Ombudsman.  While this was misleading--his duties frequently involved international travel to undisclosed locations and conferring with individuals that the university could not publicly recognize as partners--much of his work was in the vein of settling disputes.

When William Tweedie had announced his pet program for reinvigorating investigative journalism, he had personally notified Jesse that his job description would be changing.  If he felt comfortable with the plan, then he was welcome to stay.  Jesse was intrigued by the promise of hush-hush work, additional travel, and doing his part to promote an old component of journalism that he had found lacking.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement, agreed to the revised terms, and came to work the next week to find that his desk and computer had been removed.  In its place was a note from the dean and a plane ticket without a marked destination that left from a terminal at JFK that Jesse had  never heard of.  "This should be educational," he said, turning on his heel and heading toward the elevator.

"You're going to eastern Europe," the dean had told him.  "The flight plan has been filed, and your pilot knows what to do.  Here's some background for you to read over while you're over the Atlantic."  He handed Jesse a thin tablet computer whose only marking was a serial number etched into the upper right corner.

"What's the scoop?" Jesse asked, running his hand over the tablet.

"You'll find everything on there," said the dean.  "This project is the president's baby, and you probably know more than I do.  When you land, use the switch on the side of the tablet to securely erase its flash memory.  None of the information on it is illegal, but it's sensitive and we don't want you getting tied up in a rumble with immigration."

"All right," Jesse said.  He noted the location of the secure erasure switch and looked back at the dean.  "Should I pay an extra month's rent, or is this a visit for tea?"

The dean laughed.  "See you in two weeks, son."

The flight was uneventful.  The Astra Jets 1125 was cozy and quiet, carrying only three men.  Jesse had met the pilot, Lars Millsen, at a recent faculty meeting.  Jesse's nervous finger tapping caught the attention of Milssen on one occasion, prompting him to whisper something to his first officer.  A moment later, he was sitting next to Jesse in the front row of the cabin and placing a hot drink on each of their tray tables.  Jesse instinctively steadied the mug, but Milssen put him at ease.

"Don't worry, the bottoms are magnetic," Milssen said, gently tipping his own mug from side to side to show the resistance of the magnet.  "One of the perks of these corporate birds."

Jesse smiled and took a drink, trying to ease the knot in his stomach.  Green tea.  One of his favorites.  Jesse had already slogged through the 65 pages of minutiae related to the trip, undoubtedly written by the same smiling administrative assistants who handled all of the university's laundry.  He was bound for Warsaw, Poland, a place that he had visited twice for pleasure.  The third visit would be a tense one.

"Ready for duty?" Milssen asked with a smile.

"Not a chance," Jesse said, "but I'll do what I can.  These kids really stepped in it."

"The bits of news that have made it to my ear haven't been good.  Be careful, and we'll see you Thursday evening.  Give me a call when you're packed up.  We'll be starting our descent in about twenty."

Milssen handed Jesse a black prepaid mobile phone, shook his hand, and walked back to the cockpit.

Jesse knew that tomorrow, Wednesday, would be a tense affair.  He kept his nerves hidden, but his bowels never got the memo.  /I won't be doing this until I retire, unless they let me go at 32/, he thought, looking out the tiny window at the hills of central Europe.

The kids had /really/ stepped in it.  One student, the son of Polish immigrants, had enrolled in the new investigative journalism program at CUNY with a personal mission to prove that his father's failed bid for a seat on the Warsaw City Council in 1986.  The family was convinced that an opponent had floated a rumor about his father's marital fidelity shortly before the election, and that another political rival had abused her position of power at town meetings as a soapbox for making inaccurate statements about the family's intentions.  The student, Sam Rzeznick, had recruited two of his classmates to join him in Poland for a month to investigate the case.

The true story, however, had only come to light after the team of students was arrested by Interpol for breaking into the offices of a local political party and installing recording devices.  The official application for funds had stated that the team would be investigating instances of polling irregularities at a handful of small voting precincts outside of Warsaw.  The low-key nature of the trip, and the delicate issue at hand, had won over the review board and brought praise from William Tweedie.  The team had been awarded a travel and research grant for $8,000, enough to keep them fed and mobile for 30 days.
